              About <span>William Go
            </h1>
            <p class="description">
              I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science, summa cum laude, and am currently 
              certified for Amazon's AWS Cloud Practitioner. As an active member 
              of the Kellogg Honors College, consistently earning recognition on both the Dean's and 
              President's Lists throughout my academic career. My coursework included advanced studies 
              in Computer Networks, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Mobile App Development, and 
              Big Data Analytics, providing me with a well-rounded foundation in both software development 
              and data science.
              <br>
              <br>
              Throughout my academic journey, I led several impactful projects, such as Pennywise, an 
              expense tracker web application, where I served as Project Manager and Business Analyst. 
              I successfully guided a team in developing the application using React Native and 
              Amazon AWS, integrating services like Plaid for seamless bank data retrieval and budget 
              notifications. I also contributed to the development of a Vision Assistance Application that 
              employed machine learning to support visually impaired individuals, which I presented at the 
              RSCA conference at Cal Poly Pomona. Additionally, I conceptualized and launched WoolyYarnGo!, 
              a mobile app for crochet enthusiasts to track rows and stitches, previously available on the 
              Google Play Store. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies, 
              including Java, C, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, and Dart. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I am based in Los Angeles County and currently open to work. I am interested in Software Development
              and Information Technology. I enjoy working on projects that can make a positive change and have
              interest in making things disability friendly and approachable. I am eager to 
              leverage my technical expertise in software development and mobile applications to contribute 
              to innovative and challenging projects. Please feel free to contact me at wlgo0206@gmail.com
