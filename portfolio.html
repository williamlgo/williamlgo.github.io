                Description: PennyWise is an Expense Tracker web application aimed at budgeting through 
                the secure use of banking through Plaid to provide insight on spending habits. As a project 
                manager of a team of 9, my focus was on creating documentation and supporting the team 
                through ideas and organization to streamline the process of agile development. Using Figma, 
                we created an interactive UI that can react with different browser sizes and is easy to 
                understand and use from a user's perspective. Through the use of Plaid and Amazon AWS services 
                we securely connected banking information to track expenses which can be easily viewed through the application.

                Description: Many aspects of life prove to be hostile for the blind or visually impaired 
                yet through innovation and technology, it is possible to gain more independence. This 
                project aims to bridge the gap between the visually impaired and their surroundings to 
                enable them the ability to navigate and interact with objects more effectively. Using object 
                detection technology and integrating it into a real-time application with auditory feedback, 
                it is possible to gain further autonomy and awareness of one's surroundings. This application 
                uses TensorFlow's object detection model for computer vision to relay information based on 
                what is seen within a camera. The design includes some visual camera feedback for those with 
                low vision and auditory feedback that regularly scans and repeats object information. 
                This proof of concept shows the endless possibilities technology has for disability assistance.

                Description: When crocheting, keeping track of stitches and rows can be difficult. WoolyYarnGo! 
                serves as a companion mobile app for crocheting with some useful functions including counting 
                rows, stitches, and a fun random color picker wheel for your next project. This application 
                was designed on Figma and developed on Flutter and was eventually fully published on the 
                Google Play Store through Cal Poly Pomona's student development account. It is currently no 
                longer available on the Play Store but code can still be viewed on Github.

              HTML and CSS for all visuals. It includes five pages with web size reactive and interactive content. 
              This includes the ability to view my resume and contact me through a google form. The website was 
              then launched through Github's free hosting service to be viewed by you.
